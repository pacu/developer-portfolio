## Summary

I have a Master’s Degree in Software Engineering. In my more than ten years of experience in iOS development, I've worked in many projects in diverse fields and sectors: NGOs, education, mass-media, publishing, entertainment, travel and FinTechs.

The last 4 years I've been developing open source crypto-wallets and tooling in the Zcash ecosystem.
If you are Zcasher, I’m pretty sure that most of you might have interacted with the code I worked on.

I specialize in iOS development, but I've gained a lot of experience in other areas such as Blockchain, Research, Rust development, Open Source project maintenance and ecosystem outreach.


## Experience

### iOS Principal Software Engineer at Electric Coin Company
Aug 2019 - May 2023 (3 years and 10 months)

I started working at ECC as a contractor for 6 months to develop the iOS SDK for Zcash wallets. I ended staying much longer!

At ECC I was in charge of developing the first Zcash iOS SDK and the reference wallet applications. Partners and community members would use them to adopt Zcash in their codebases. I worked with amazing teams like Unstoppable, Edge and Nighthawk to support their needs as clients of the Zcash SDK.

In my day to day work, I was in charge of development, planning, scoping and release management of the Wallet team code alongside my Android counterpart. Besides being on top of the latest developments of the iOS ecosystem, it was also necessary to understand the underpinnings of the Zcash protocol and the different ZIPs (Zcash improvement proposals) to implement them on the SDK. This was a complex task which required using both Swift and Rust Lang. I was also in charge of planning the team's sprints and work besides the protocol team to articulate software releases of the SDKs and internal testing versions of the applications..

A summary of the projects I worked on can be found in my [developer portfolio](./PORTFOLIO.md)

Techonologies: SwiftUI, Swift, UIKit, Rust, C, Zcash, Bitcoin, Kotlin, GoLang, Python, CI (GH Actions, Bitrise)

Methodologies: TDD, Scrum

### Freelance iOS Developer at Upstack
Jul 2019 - Mar 2021 (1 year 9 months)

This was a Freelance developer per-hour kind consultant role.

### iOS Developer at HighSide.
Nov 2018 - Jun 2019 (8 months)

Worked as iOS Sr. developer for the HighSide iOS App, taking over the existing codebase and doing
general maintenance and bootstrapping CI infrastructure to automate builds and delivery through
testflight.

Technologies: UIKit, Swift, Objective-C, Core Data, Circle CI, Ruby.

### iOS Lead Developer at Despegar 
Jul 2016 - Nov 2018 (2 years 5 months)

Worked as a Lead Developer for the Flighs, Hotels and Packages Shopping Cart section of the Despegar and Decolar iOS App. Managed a team of 4 developers which was part of the around 30 incredible iOS developers in total that worked on the different areas of the application. Despegar and Decolar were featured repeatedly in the App Store for their popularity, excellence and designs. The team leads were in charge of release management, product development, sprint planning, mentoring and also feature development. 

Depegar managed the whole Hotels and flights business end-to-end so it was a great opportunity to work
in a fast-paced environment, where product developement, KPIs, UX metrics shaped the upcoming changes
of the mobile applications used by millions of users in LATAM.

Technologies: iOS, Swift, Objective-C, UIKit, BuddyBuild, Jenkins, Ruby, Java. 

Methodologies: TDD, Scrum, A/B Testing.


### iOS Tech Lead at Globant
Apr 2013 - Jul 2016 (3 years 4 months)

I started as a part-time Sr iOS developer and grew to lead team of 11 developers
who worked both on-site and off-shore and different skills (iOS, Android, WebUI and UX/VD).
I mostly worked in a staff augmentation profect for a very important global Investment Firm, 
developing in-house solutions for the different departments of the company. We had high
security standards and all applications were subject to thorough QA and penetration testing and
the mandatory audits. 


As a Tech Lead, I was collaborated with the Sales Team in RFPs and RFI proposals 
for Globant's potencial customers 

Technologies: iOS, Objective-C, C, UIKit, Core Data, Jenkins, Jira, Sharepoint.

Methodologies: TDD, Scrum, OWASP mobile security.


### Co-Founder at Pixel Publishers 
Sep 2012 - Oct 2014 (2 years 2 months)

Partnered with Illustrators, comic book and children's literature authors and storytellers from all over the world to help them publish their creations on the Apple App Store.

They created great literature, we took care of the rest.

I Also developed the Backend using Ruby-on-Rails. 

Technologies: iOS, Objective-C, C, UIKit, Core Data, Fastlane, StoreKit, Ruby, Rails, Amazon EC2 and S3.


### iOS Lead Developer Green Star Digital Ltd.
Nov 2010 - Jan 2012 (1 year 3 months)

I was the Lead developer of GS MAG pdf reader engine. I created a very efficient iOS PDF Reader App that the company white-labeled to sell to different publishers. This was the pre-Newsstand era,
where different publishers needed to launch their own apps to be present in the App Store. 

The application allowed to bundle a free issue of the collection and then buy the rest through
app store in-app purchases. PDFs could be annotated by content producers to inline media and
other interactive elements to create an immersive experience with existing issues from traditional
printed magazines. The PDFs were really high-resolution and I had to work with Core Foundation to
get the most of iPad 1 and achive a smooth experience.

Technologies: iOS, Objective-C, C, UIKit, Core Data, Core Foundation, Adobe PDF, StoreKit.

### Jave ME Retroporting at Gameloft
Feb 2008 - Dec 2008 (11 months)

I started as a Jr developer in the Jave ME retroporting team. My job consisted in getting a Game port
request from the game producer and a deadline for it. We were given the target devices (low-end not-smart phones) and a source code to depart from. We had to an iterative waterfall process where
the game would be ported, bugfixed, tested, approved for gold and released to the public.

This was one of the best learning experiences a Junior dev could have in terms of practical knowledge. In a regular day one would have to jump into a unknown codebase, with custom build
systems, different technologies, informal game engines and accommodate it so the game would pass the thorough QA criteria from the Quality department. 

Techonologies: Java ME, C, Microsoft Batch, Python, SVN.
Methodologies: Iterative Waterfall. 

## Education

### Master in Software Engineering (2021)
I graduated with grade 10/10 in the Master's degree in Software Engineering program at Faculty of Informatics of UNLP. 

Thesis: "Arquitectura de software en wallet de código abierto para privacy coin en dispositivos móviles. El caso de estudio de Zcash"

(Open Source privacy coin wallet software architecture for mobile devices, the Zcash case study)

<p>
Since their appearance in 2009, the use of cryptocurrencies has been growing constantly in terms of market cap and adoption. This boom is publicly visible as well as the grand majority of the decentralized finance transactions. Despite the use of advanced cryptography, privacy in the “crypto world” is relitvely low, with certain exceptions: Privacy Coins (or Anonymity Enhanced Coins AEC). This work takes the idea of Privacy as a Human Right and focuses on elicitating the requirements for developing mobile wallets for AECs, analyzing the cryptocurrencies Monero and primarily Zcash, taking the latter as study case. Its contributions are: a list of functional and non-functional requirements to develop a privacy coin light client, a reference Architecture that addresses these requirements in an abstract manner and finally a list of future work related to the fields of Systematic Literature Review, Privacy and Security.
