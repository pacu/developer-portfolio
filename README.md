## About Myself

Hello! My name is Francisco and everyone calls me 'Pacu'. I’m a Software Developer and I've been working in the mobile apps industry for more than 10 years. I like building software with others,
understand how things work and look for the best solutions possible for the context. I consider
myself as someone capable to reconcile academic R&D and pragmatic approaches in software engineering.

I've specialized myself in iOS development but I have a diverse interest and experience in software engineering. The last few years of my career have been completely dedicated to build open source software within the Zcash ecosystem. If you are Zcasher, I’m pretty sure that you might have interacted with the code I worked on.

I’ve been developing software since 2008. I always liked to work on stuff that people could take into their own hands. First as a retro-porter at Gameloft where I learned to move around a myriad of code bases and game engines to fit popular games into low-end JavaME mobile phones, since then I’ve been dedicated to iOS applications. 

In these last 16 years, I’ve worked in many kinds of companies and teams: Corporations, Unicorns, freelance gigs and start-ups. I think each one of them is a different kind of challenge and require different mindsets. I have learned to adapt the constraints every kind of team, and to make "the best of what's around" in every situation. 

In my last big company job, I worked with more than 60 mobile developers serving millions of users in LATAM for the most popular online travel agency of the region. I can say that I have the experience of walking into a bar and knowing that everyone there has your App on their phones. 

I also worked in a variety of distinct application domains such as publishing, Investment Firms, Entertainment Corporations, Travel and Leisure companies and lastly decentralizing finance and fighting for the right to privacy within the cryptocurrency space. 

All of these experiences had one link between them. I've always worked within the last mile of the software chain: from the server to people’s fingertips. 

As for personal interests, I like surfing, cooking, making music and playing with my cats and dogs. 

I speak Spanish, English and Italian.
